### Rules Have Not Yet Been Decided for the Game
#### Potential Ideas:
Racko inspired game where players try to make runs of numbers and suits  
Uno or Crazy-8s like game  
Push your luck game

### Game Idea: Midnight
Players attempt to make a clock with the cards drawing one at a time (Ace-Queen; King is wild). They can stop at any time, but if a card of duplicate value is drawn, the player loses all progress they made that turn. If 3 (subject to change) rounds go by without a winner, the player with the longest streak wins. If this is a tie, the player with the longest mono-color streak wins, and mono-suit streak if a winner is still not clear.
